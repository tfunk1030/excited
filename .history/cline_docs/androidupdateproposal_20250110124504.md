- Better incremental build support
- Improved resource processing
- Enhanced build cache
- Better Android Studio integration

#### Cons:
- Potential breaking changes in build scripts
- May require updates to custom Gradle tasks
- Possible compatibility issues with older plugins

**Proposed:** 0.73.0

#### Pros:
- Better Hermes engine support
- Improved native module handling
- Enhanced build reliability
- Better debugging tools
- Support for latest React Native features

#### Cons:
- May require updates to native code
- Potential breaking changes in existing configurations
- Possible issues with third-party libraries

### 3. Kotlin Version Update
**Current:** 1.7.20  
**Proposed:** 1.9.24

#### Pros:
- Access to latest language features
- Better performance
- Improved null safety
- Enhanced coroutine support
- Better Java interoperability

#### Cons:
- May require code changes for deprecated features
- Potential compatibility issues with older libraries
- Increased build time for first compile

---

### 4. Java Version Configuration
**Current:** Java 11  
**Proposed:** Java 17

#### Pros:
- Better performance
- Modern language features
- Improved security
- Better memory management
- Enhanced garbage collection

#### Cons:
- May require updates to build tools
- Potential compatibility issues with older libraries
- Need to verify CI/CD environment support

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. AGP 8.1.0 migration
2. React Native plugin update
3. Kotlin version compatibility

### Medium Risk Areas
1. Java version update
2. Build cache behavior changes
3. Resource processing changes

### Low Risk Areas
1. Dependency resolution strategy
2. Repository configuration
3. Basic build tasks

## Implementation Plan

1. **Preparation Phase**
   - Create backup branch
   - Document current configuration
   - Set up testing environment

2. **Update Phase**
   - Update AGP first
   - Update React Native plugin
   - Update Kotlin version
   - Update Java version

3. **Testing Phase**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Build performance tests
   - Memory usage tests

4. **Rollout Phase**
   - Staging environment testing
   - Production rollout
   - Monitoring and feedback

---

## Backup Plan

1. Revert to previous versions
2. Use backup configuration
3. Clear Gradle cache if needed
4. Rollback to previous branch

---

## Estimated Timeline

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Preparation | 2 days |
| Update | 3 days |
| Testing | 5 days |
| Rollout | 2 days |
| Total | 12 days |

## Decision Points

1. Proceed with full update
2. Update components individually
3. Postpone update
4. Partial update (select components)

## Documentation Updates Required

1. `techStack.md`
2. `codebaseSummary.md`
3. `reference_configs/README.md`
4. Build process documentation
