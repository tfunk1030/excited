# Current Task

## Current Objectives
- Fix React Native Android build error with enhanced Gradle cleanup
- Implement robust error handling and recovery
- Ensure consistent Java 17 environment

## Context
- Build failing due to Gradle metadata cache corruption
- Previous attempts to clean cache were insufficient
- Need for more thorough process management
- Multiple native dependencies require careful handling

## Next Steps
1. Execute enhanced fix_gradle_issues.ps1 script which:
   - Terminates all Java processes
   - Performs complete Gradle reset
   - Rebuilds with error handling
   - Uses safer Gradle 8.0.0 version

2. If build succeeds:
   - Verify native module functionality
   - Test app launch and basic features
   - Document successful configuration

3. If issues persist:
   - Follow expanded troubleshooting guide
   - Check each native module's compatibility
   - Review Android SDK configuration

## Implementation Details
- Enhanced fix_gradle_issues.ps1 with:
  * Complete process management
  * Thorough cache cleanup
  * Error recovery mechanisms
  * Safer Gradle configuration
- Updated documentation with:
  * Detailed troubleshooting steps
  * Common error solutions
  * Process verification steps
