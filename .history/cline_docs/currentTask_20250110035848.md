# Current Task

## Current Objectives
✓ Fix React Native Android build error with validated Gradle configurations
✓ Implement reference configuration system
✓ Ensure consistent build environment

## Context
- Version requirements have been validated and documented
- Confirmed Gradle 7.3.1 compatibility with React Native 0.72.7
- Reference configuration system implemented and documented
- Future upgrade path to Gradle 8.x documented for RN 0.73+

## Next Steps
1. Monitor build stability with current configurations:
   - Track any build issues
   - Document any workarounds needed
   - Keep version_requirements.md updated
   - Plan for future React Native upgrades

2. Apply reference configurations:
   - Use templates from reference_configs directory
   - Follow version compatibility guidelines
   - Implement clean build process
   - Test with validated settings

3. Maintain configuration stability:
   - Document working configurations
   - Monitor version updates
   - Keep reference files updated
   - Regular validation checks

## Implementation Details
- Created reference_configs directory with:
  * Validated Gradle configurations
  * Version compatibility matrix
  * Common issues and solutions
  * Build process documentation
- Enhanced build scripts with:
  * Version verification
  * Configuration validation
  * Error recovery procedures
  * Clean build process
