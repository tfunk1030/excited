   - Document any workarounds needed
   - Keep version_requirements.md updated
   - Plan for future React Native upgrades

2. Maintain configuration stability:
   - Document working configurations
   - Monitor version updates
   - Keep reference files updated
   - Regular validation checks

## Implementation Details
- Updated version_requirements.md with exact working versions
