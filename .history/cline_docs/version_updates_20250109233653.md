## Conclusion
While there are some newer versions available, most of our dependencies are relatively up-to-date. The most significant potential updates would be:
1. Android Gradle Plugin (8.3.0 → 8.8.0)
2. @react-navigation/bottom-tabs to v7
3. Kotlin (1.8.0 → 2.0.20)
4. NDK (25.1.8937393 → 27.0.12077973)
5. react-native-safe-area-context update to v5

## Next Steps
1. Consider updating react-native-safe-area-context first as a lower-risk improvement
2. Plan a staged update approach:
   - First stage: Update Android Gradle Plugin and Gradle
   - Second stage: Update NDK
   - Third stage: Update Kotlin (requires more testing due to major version change)
   - Fourth stage: Update @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
3. Monitor for any critical updates to other dependencies
4. Keep current versions for packages that are already up-to-date or stable

## Update Risks

### Low Risk Updates
- react-native-safe-area-context (4.8.2 → 5.1.0)
- Android Gradle Plugin (8.3.0 → 8.8.0)
- NDK update

### Medium Risk Updates
- Gradle update (required for AGP update)
- Build Tools update

### Higher Risk Updates
