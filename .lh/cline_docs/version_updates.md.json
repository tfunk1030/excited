The most significant potential updates would be:\r\n+1. Android Gradle Plugin (8.3.0 → 8.8.0)\r\n+2. @react-navigation/bottom-tabs to v7\r\n+3. Kotlin (1.8.0 → 2.0.20)\r\n+4. NDK (25.1.8937393 → 27.0.12077973)\r\n+5. react-native-safe-area-context update to v5\r\n+\r\n+## Next Steps\r\n+1. Consider updating react-native-safe-area-context first as a lower-risk improvement\r\n+2. Plan a staged update approach:\r\n+   - First stage: Update Android Gradle Plugin and Gradle\r\n+   - Second stage: Update NDK\r\n+   - Third stage: Update Kotlin (requires more testing due to major version change)\r\n+   - Fourth stage: Update @react-navigation/bottom-tabs\r\n+3. Monitor for any critical updates to other dependencies\r\n+4. Keep current versions for packages that are already up-to-date or stable\r\n+\r\n+## Update Risks\r\n+\r\n+### Low Risk Updates\r\n+- react-native-safe-area-context (4.8.2 → 5.1.0)\r\n+- Android Gradle Plugin (8.3.0 → 8.8.0)\r\n+- NDK update\r\n+\r\n+### Medium Risk Updates\r\n+- Gradle update (required for AGP update)\r\n+- Build Tools update\r\n+\r\n+### Higher Risk Updates\r\n+- Kotlin 2.0.20 (major version update)\r\n+- @react-navigation/bottom-tabs v7 (major version update)\r\n"
