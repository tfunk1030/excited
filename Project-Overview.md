# Golf Shot Calculator - Technical Requirements Document

## Project Overview
Building a highly accurate golf shot calculator that accounts for environmental conditions, club data, and uses machine learning to improve accuracy over time. The system must handle real-time calculations, weather data, and shot tracking. The user will enter a target yardage and the calculator will output the adjusted yardage the given shot will be playing in real time. Based off our research implemented in the Calculation model, it will determine the current weather and club the user will be using and output an adjusted total yardage and aim point laterally based on wind.
