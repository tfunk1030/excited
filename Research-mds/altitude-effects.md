1000         | 0.971            | +2.1%
2000         | 0.942            | +4.3%
3000         | 0.915            | +6.5%
4000         | 0.888            | +8.8%
5000         | 0.862            | +11.2%
6000         | 0.837            | +13.7%
7000         | 0.813            | +16.3%

## Ball Flight Characteristics

### Trajectory Changes
- Lower maximum height
- Reduced spin effect
- Changed descent angle
- Different roll characteristics

### Spin Decay
- Reduced spin maintenance
- Changed shot shape effects
- Different landing conditions

## Launch Monitor Data
- TrackMan Altitude Studies
- FlightScope Elevation Testing
- GC Quad Mountain Course Data

## Mathematical Models
```typescript
// Altitude adjustment calculations
const altitudeEffect = {
    airDensity: seaLevelDensity * Math.exp(-altitude/29000),
    dragCoefficient: baseDrag * (1 - densityRatio * 0.1),
    spinEffect: baseSpin * densityRatio
};
```

## Real-World Validation
- PGA Tour Mountain Tournament Data
- European Tour High Altitude Events
- Amateur Tournament Statistics
