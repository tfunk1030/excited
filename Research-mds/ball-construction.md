# Golf Ball Construction Impact on Flight - Research Summary

## Ball Types and Characteristics

### 1. Multi-Layer Construction
```
Layer Count | Typical Construction    | Primary Effect
2-piece     | Core + Cover           | Distance, less spin
3-piece     | Core + Mantle + Cover  | Balance of distance/spin
4-piece     | Core + 2 Mantles + Cover| More spin control
5-piece     | Core + 3 Mantles + Cover| Maximum spin separation
```

### 2. Compression Ratings
```
Rating | Core Hardness | Optimal Swing Speed
Low (70-80)   | Soft    | Below 85 mph
Mid (85-95)   | Medium  | 85-95 mph
High (100+)   | Firm    | Above 95 mph
```

## Dimple Patterns

### 1. Pattern Types
```
Pattern Type    | Dimple Count | Flight Characteristics
Icosahedral    | 332-392      | Stable, penetrating
Octahedral     | 336-392      | Higher flight
Tetrahedral    | 320-372      | Lower spin
Hybrid         | 318-388      | Balanced performance
```

### 2. Dimple Effects
- Drag reduction: 50% less than smooth ball
- Lift generation: Up to 2x more lift
- Turbulence creation: Delayed flow separation

## Material Properties

### 1. Cover Materials
```
Material        | Hardness | Spin    | Durability
Surlyn         | Higher   | Lower   | Excellent
Urethane       | Lower    | Higher  | Good
HPF (Ionomer)  | Medium   | Medium  | Very Good
```

### 2. Core Materials
```
Material        | Compression | Energy Return
Polybutadiene  | Variable    | 92-95%
HPF            | Medium      | 90-93%
Rubber Blend   | High        | 88-91%
```

## Performance Data

### 1. Weather Impact by Construction
```
Ball Type      | Cold Weather | Hot Weather | Wet Conditions
2-piece        | -1.5%       | +1.2%       | -0.8%
3-piece        | -1.8%       | +1.4%       | -1.0%
4/5-piece      | -2.1%       | +1.6%       | -1.2%
```

### 2. Altitude Effects by Construction
```
Ball Type      | 1000ft  | 3000ft  | 5000ft
2-piece        | +1.9%   | +5.8%   | +9.7%
3-piece        | +2.1%   | +6.2%   | +10.2%
4/5-piece      | +2.2%   | +6.5%   | +10.6%
```
