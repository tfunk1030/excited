# Temperature Effects on Golf Ball Flight - Research Summary

## Ball Compression Studies

### 1. Golf Laboratories Testing (2021)
- Temperature vs. Compression Rating
- COR (Coefficient of Restitution) Changes
- Impact on Ball Speed

- Callaway Ball Performance Data
- TaylorMade Climate Chamber Results

## Air Density Impact

### 1. Physics Research
```
Temperature (°F) | Relative Air Density
40              | 1.06
50              | 1.04
60              | 1.02
70              | 1.00 (baseline)
80              | 0.98
90              | 0.96
100             | 0.94
```

### 2. Distance Effects
- Every 10°F increase:
  - Air density decreases ~2%
  - Ball speed increases ~0.3%
  - Carry distance changes ~1-2 yards

## Ball Construction Impact

### Multi-Layer Balls
- Core temperature sensitivity
- Mantle layer effects
- Cover material changes

### Two-Piece Balls
- Generally less temperature sensitive
- More consistent across temperature range

## Launch Monitor Data
- TrackMan Temperature Studies
- FlightScope Environmental Testing
- GC Quad Climate Analysis

## Mathematical Models
```typescript
// Temperature adjustment calculation
const tempEffect = {
    airDensity: baseDensity * (1 - 0.002 * tempDiffFrom70),
    ballSpeed: baseSpeed * (1 + 0.003 * tempDiffFrom70),
    compression: baseCompression * (1 - 0.001 * tempDiffFrom70)
};
```
