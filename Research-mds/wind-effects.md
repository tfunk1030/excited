## Key Findings

### Wind Gradient Effects
```
Height (ft)    | Wind Speed Multiplier
0-10           | 0.75x
10-50          | 0.85x
50-100         | 1.0x
100-150        | 1.15x
150+           | 1.25x
```

### Crosswind Lift
- Creates 0.3-0.4x the effect of headwind
- Varies with spin rate
- Maximum effect at apex of flight

### Turbulence Effects
- Reduces effective drag by 5-15%
- More impact on higher trajectory shots
- Varies with surface roughness

## Real-World Validation
- TrackMan data from PGA Tour events
- European Tour Weather Station Data
- Launch monitor studies

## Mathematical Models
```typescript
// Wind effect calculation based on height
const windEffect = baseWindSpeed * heightMultiplier * spinFactor;
```
