# Codebase Summary

## Current Status and Issues

### Known Issues
1. UI Implementation:
   - Several buttons not functional
   - Input fields need proper validation
   - Display numbers with appropriate precision:
     * Whole numbers: distances, altitude, pressure, humidity
     * One decimal: temperature, feels like temperature
     * Three decimals: air density
   - Navigation doesn't match parprecisionui.com

2. Core Functionality:
   - yardage_model_enhanced.py not integrated
   - Calculations not matching web version
   - Weather data integration incomplete
   - Input validation missing

3. Workflow:
   - Structure differs from parprecisionui.com
   - User flow needs alignment
   - Missing key interactions
   - Navigation needs updating

## Components Structure

### Navigation (Needs Updates)
- Drawer navigation implemented but needs revision
- Navigation flow differs from web version
- Menu structure needs alignment

### Screens (Require Fixes)
#### Shot Calculator
- Target distance slider (needs validation)
- Environmental adjustments (needs decimal fix)
- Total adjustment (needs yardage_model_enhanced)
- Club recommendations (incomplete)

#### Weather
- Current conditions (needs decimal fix)
- Temperature display (needs validation)
- Grid layout (needs proper data)
- Sensor integration (incomplete)

#### Wind Calculator
- Compass (needs interaction fixes)
- Speed controls (needs validation)
- Target yardage (needs proper handling)
- Effect calculation (needs implementation)

#### Settings
- Unit preferences (needs persistence)
- Club management (needs validation)
- Data storage (not implemented)
- Input handling (needs fixes)

## Data Flow (Needs Implementation)
- Local state management incomplete
- Environmental data not integrated
- Club data not persistent
- Settings not synchronized
- Calculations not using yardage_model_enhanced

## External Dependencies
### Core Dependencies
- expo: ^52.0.25
- expo-router: ~4.0.16
- react-native-reanimated: ~3.16.1
- react-native-gesture-handler: ~2.20.2
- @react-native-community/slider: 4.5.5

### Required Implementations
- yardage_model_enhanced integration
- Proper data validation
- Error handling
- Input field management
- Decimal formatting

## Build and Development
### Development
- Using bun for package management
- Local development with expo-cli
- TypeScript for type checking

### Production (Not Ready)
- Build process needs review
- Testing not implemented
- Error handling missing
- Performance not optimized

```

### Structural Changes Planned
- Consolidating src/ directory into app/ for clearer structure
- Moving shared/types.ts into app/types.ts
- Removing duplicate theme files
- Removing weather.tsx (functionality moved to index.tsx)

## Next Steps
1. Integrate yardage_model_enhanced.py
2. Fix decimal place formatting
3. Implement proper input validation
4. Update navigation to match web version
5. Add proper error handling
6. Implement data persistence
7. Add comprehensive testing

## Notes
- All calculations must use yardage_model_enhanced
- UI must match parprecisionui.com exactly
- All numbers should display 1 decimal place
- Need to implement proper input validation
- Navigation structure needs complete revision
