# Current Task

## UI Implementation and Functionality Issues

### Current Issues
1. UI Discrepancies:
   - ✓ All buttons are now functional with proper handlers
   - ✓ Input fields have validation and error handling
   - ✓ Display numbers with appropriate precision:
     * ✓ Whole numbers: distances, altitude, pressure, humidity
     * ✓ One decimal: temperature, feels like temperature
     * ✓ Three decimals: air density
   - ✓ Navigation structure matches parprecisionui.com

2. Workflow Mismatches:
   - ✓ Implementation matches parprecisionui.com structure
   - ✓ User flow aligned with web version
   - ✓ Key interactions implemented with proper feedback

3. Core Functionality:
   - yardage_model_enhanced.py integration prepared but not implemented
   - Advanced calculations prepared with loading states and error handling
   - Weather data integration prepared with proper types and interfaces
   - Need to:
     * Implement actual yardage_model_enhanced.py calculations
     * Connect to real weather data API
     * Add data persistence for settings
     * Add comprehensive error handling with user feedback

### Required Fixes
1. UI Fixes:
   - ✓ Implemented all button functionality with proper handlers
   - ✓ Added input field validation and error handling
   - ✓ Updated number formatting (3 decimals for air density, whole numbers for others)
   - ✓ Matched navigation to parprecisionui.com

2. Integration Needs:
   - Implement yardage_model_enhanced.py calculations
   - Connect to real weather data API
   - ✓ Added error handling infrastructure
   - Implement data persistence for settings
   - Add comprehensive testing

3. Workflow Updates:
   - Review parprecisionui.com structure
   - Update navigation flow
   - Add missing interactions
   - Match functionality

### Next Steps
1. Immediate Actions:
   - ✓ Fixed decimal place formatting
   - ✓ Implemented missing button functionality
   - ✓ Added input field handling and validation
   - ✓ Added error handling infrastructure
   - Implement yardage_model_enhanced.py calculations
   - Connect to real weather data API

2. Secondary Tasks:
   - ✓ Matched parprecisionui.com workflow
   - ✓ Updated navigation structure
   - ✓ Added proper data validation
   - ✓ Split code into reusable components
   - ✓ Added loading states and error handling
   - Implement data persistence for settings

3. Final Phase:
   - Add comprehensive testing suite
   - Test yardage_model_enhanced.py integration
   - Test weather data integration
   - Test data persistence
   - Add API error handling
   - Add user feedback for all error states
   - Add documentation for components
   - Prepare for deployment
