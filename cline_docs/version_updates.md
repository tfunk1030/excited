# Version Updates and Build Configuration Changes

## Recent Updates

### Build Configuration Changes
- Simplified GradleException usage in app/build.gradle
  * Removed unnecessary full package name
  * GradleException is now referenced directly in Gradle build script context

## Known Issues

1. Line Ending Standardization
   - babel.config.js shows CRLF line ending warnings
   - These are linting warnings and don't affect functionality
   - Consider adding .editorconfig or eslint configuration to standardize line endings

2. Node Modules Configuration
   - Missing .settings folders in node_modules directories
   - Not critical for build process
   - These are development-time artifacts

## Version Matrix

### Current Versions
- React Native: 0.76.x
- React Native Gradle Plugin: 0.76.6 (fixed)
- Gradle: 8.10.2
- Kotlin: 1.9.24

### Target Versions
- Gradle: 8.10.2
- Kotlin: 1.9.24
- Maintaining react-native-gradle-plugin at 0.76.6

## Next Steps
1. Continue with Gradle version upgrade
2. Plan Kotlin version update
3. Consider adding .editorconfig for consistent line endings
4. Document any version-specific workarounds
