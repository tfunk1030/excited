# Advanced Wind Effects on Ball Flight

## Wind Profile Analysis

### 1. Vertical Wind Profile

60-100      | 1.15                 | Peak trajectory impact
100+        | 1.25                 | Maximum effect
```

### 2. Wind Direction Impact
```
Wind Angle | Effective Speed | Primary Effect
Head (0°)  | 100%          | Distance reduction
Tail (180°)| 50%           | Distance increase
Cross (90°)| 70%           | Lateral movement + lift
Quarter    | 85%           | Combined effects
```

## Trajectory Modifications

### 1. Height-Based Wind Effect
```
Shot Height | Wind Impact | Flight Characteristic
Low (<20y)  | 0.8x       | More penetrating
Med (20-35y)| 1.0x       | Standard effect
High (>35y) | 1.3x       | More wind affected
```

### 2. Ball Speed vs Wind Effect
```
Ball Speed | Wind Effect Multiplier | Notes
120 mph    | 1.2x                  | More affected
140 mph    | 1.0x                  | Standard effect
160 mph    | 0.85x                 | Less affected
180 mph    | 0.75x                 | Minimal effect
```

## Advanced Wind Calculations

### 1. Crosswind Lift Generation
```
Wind Speed | Spin Axis  | Lateral Movement/100y | Additional Lift
5 mph      | 0°        | 2.5 yards            | +1%
10 mph     | 0°        | 5.5 yards            | +2%
15 mph     | 0°        | 9.0 yards            | +3%
5 mph      | 15°       | 3.0 yards            | +1.5%
10 mph     | 15°       | 6.5 yards            | +2.5%
15 mph     | 15°       | 10.5 yards           | +3.5%
```

### 2. Wind Shear Effects
```
Height Change | Wind Change | Effect on Ball
0-50 ft      | +3 mph     | Early trajectory bend
50-100 ft    | +5 mph     | Mid-flight adjustment
100-150 ft   | +7 mph     | Late trajectory bend
```

## Turbulence Impact

### 1. Stability Categories
```
Condition  | Turbulence | Effect on Accuracy
Stable     | Low        | ±2% distance
Neutral    | Medium     | ±3% distance
Unstable   | High       | ±5% distance
```

### 2. Surface Roughness Effects
```
Terrain    | Roughness Length | Wind Profile
Water      | 0.0002          | Smooth
Fairway    | 0.03            | Light rough
Trees      | 0.5             | Very rough
Buildings  | 1.0             | Extreme rough
```

## Complex Wind Scenarios

### 1. Switching Winds
```
Wind Change | Height of Change | Effect on Ball
5 mph       | 50 ft           | Minor adjustment
10 mph      | 50 ft           | Major adjustment
5 mph       | 100 ft          | Moderate high
10 mph      | 100 ft          | Severe high
```

### 2. Thermal Effects
```
Time of Day | Condition | Wind Behavior
Morning     | Stable    | Consistent
Midday      | Unstable  | Variable
Evening     | Stable    | Consistent
```

## Mathematical Models

### 1. Wind Vector Calculations
```
V_effective = V_ball + V_wind
Where:
V_effective = Effective velocity vector
V_ball = Ball velocity vector
V_wind = Wind velocity vector (height-adjusted)
```

### 2. Crosswind Lift
```
L = ½ρv²CLA
Where:
L = Lift force
ρ = Air density
v = Relative velocity
CL = Lift coefficient
A = Cross-sectional area
```

### 1. Professional Adjustments
```
Wind Speed | Pro Adjustment | Amateur Adjustment
5 mph      | 2-3%          | 3-4%
10 mph     | 4-6%          | 6-8%
15 mph     | 7-9%          | 10-12%
20 mph     | 10-12%        | 13-16%
```

### 2. Tournament Data
```
Condition           | Scoring Average | GIR %
No Wind (<5 mph)    | 70.2           | 68%
Light (5-10 mph)    | 70.8           | 65%
Moderate (10-15 mph)| 71.6           | 62%
Strong (15+ mph)    | 72.5           | 58%
