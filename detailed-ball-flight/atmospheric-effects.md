## Mathematical Models

### 1. Air Density Formula
```
ρ = (P * M) / (R * T)

Where:
ρ = air density
P = pressure (Pa)
M = molar mass of air
R = gas constant
T = temperature (K)
```

### 2. Distance Adjustment
```
D_adjusted = D_baseline * √(ρ_sea level / ρ_actual)

Modified for humidity:
ρ_humid = ρ_dry * (1 - 0.378 * e/P)
Where:
e = vapor pressure
P = total pressure
