## Advanced Energy Calculations

### 1. Kinetic Energy Formula
```
KE = ½mv²
Where:
m = mass of ball (45.93g)
v = velocity
Conservation: KE(club) * efficiency = KE(ball)
```

### 2. Momentum Transfer
```
p = mv
Where:
p = momentum
m = mass
v = velocity
Conservation: p(club) = p(ball) + p(club rebound)
```
