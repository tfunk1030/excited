## Mathematical Models

### 1. Air Density Calculation
```
ρ = (P * M) / (R * T)
Where:
ρ = air density
P = pressure
M = molar mass of air
R = gas constant
T = temperature (Kelvin)
```

### 2. Distance Adjustment
```
D_adjusted = D_baseline * √(ρ_sea level / ρ_actual)
Where:
D_adjusted = Adjusted distance
D_baseline = Sea level distance
ρ = Air density
