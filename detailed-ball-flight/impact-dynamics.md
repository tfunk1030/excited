## Mathematical Models

### 1. Impact Force
```
F = m(Δv/Δt)

Where:
F = impact force
m = effective mass
Δv = velocity change
Δt = impact duration
```

### 2. Energy Conservation
```
½mv₁² = ½mv₂² + E_loss

Where:
v₁ = incoming velocity
v₂ = outgoing velocity
E_loss = energy lost to heat/deformation
```
