Please use your SequentialThinking, fetch and WebResearch MCP servers to thoroughly review the parprecisionui application. I need you to do the following:

Verify Expo Requirements and Dependencies

Check that the app is using all necessary Expo packages and add-ons.
Confirm the current dependencies and ensure they are compatible with both Expo builds and EAS builds.
UI/UX Confirmation

Compare the application’s UI against the screenshots I will provide.
Make sure every screen and design element matches exactly.
Confirm the app’s performance and user flow match the experience on parprecisionui.com.
Platform Compatibility

Test the app’s ability to run on both iOS and Android platforms.
Verify the build process using both Expo and EAS to ensure no errors occur.
Please return a detailed report of your findings, including any discrepancies or errors uncovered during your analysis. Also note any recommendations for improvement or troubleshooting steps, if needed.

Thank you
